# research about the Async library for Ocaml

started by googling `async ocaml`  
looked at the folowing source https://opensource.janestreet.com/async/  
that did not contain much info about what could be done with the library  
found this link on the page https://v3.ocaml.org/p/async/latest/doc/Async/index.html
while this page contains a list of many thinks inside of the library, it does not apper to contain examples.

back to the google search  
found a link to the text book Real World OCaml  
this section appers to contain many examples of how to use the async library.  
the section is chaper 18 Concurrent Programming with Async
